Determining which option is better.
The first option is 100 dollars per day for 10 days. 
The second option is 1 dollar a day with a doubling each day for 10 days.
There are two functions that will calculate the pay rate.
function1 will be calculating the amount for the very first option, while function2 will be calculating
the amount for the second option.

function1 will output 100 x 10 days.
function2 will loop 10 times doubling the amount and add the amount to the total each time.

If the option1 is better, we will output to the user "Option 1 is better"
If the option2 is better, we will output to the user "Option 2 is better"
If the amount is equal, we will output to the user "Option 1 and Option 2 pays the same"
